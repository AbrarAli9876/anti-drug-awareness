  {
    question: "Is addiction a choice or a disease?",
    answer: "Addiction is not simply a choice — it is a complex health condition. While trying a substance the first time may be a choice, long-term use changes the brain’s chemistry. It is influenced by biology, environment, and stress. Like diabetes or asthma, it requires treatment and patience."
  },
  {
    question: "Can someone recover from addiction?",
    answer: "Yes. Recovery is absolutely possible. Millions recover with the right support, which may include counseling, medical treatment, healthy routines, and family support. Early help improves outcomes significantly."
  },
  {
    question: "What do I do if my friend refuses help?",
    answer: "It is common to deny a problem. Stay calm, don't argue, and keep communication open. Encourage small steps like talking to a counselor. Set healthy boundaries to protect your own well-being. Your consistent support may help them seek help later."
  },
  {
    question: "Are prescription drugs safer than illegal drugs?",
    answer: "Prescription drugs are safe ONLY when used exactly as directed. Misusing them (higher doses, mixing with alcohol) can be extremely dangerous. Opioids, anxiety meds, and stimulants are highly addictive when misused."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if someone is developing an addiction?",
    answer: "Early signs include secrecy, mood swings, withdrawal from family, falling grades, financial problems, and physical changes like red eyes or shaking. If these continue for weeks, encourage them to seek help."
  },
  {
    question: "Can addiction happen to anyone?",
    answer: "Yes. Addiction does not discriminate. It affects students, professionals, parents, and athletes. Genetics, stress, trauma, and environment all play a role."
  },
  {
    question: "Why can’t someone 'just stop'?",
    answer: "Addiction changes brain circuits related to reward and self-control. Stopping suddenly can cause severe withdrawal symptoms like anxiety, shaking, and nausea, which is why professional help is often needed."
  },
  {
    question: "What should I do during an overdose?",
    answer: "Call emergency services immediately (112 or 108). Do not leave them alone. Check breathing. Keep them on their side (recovery position). Do not give food/water. Stay calm until help arrives."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it okay to drink alcohol socially?",
    answer: "For adults, moderate drinking may be acceptable, but teens should avoid it completely as it affects brain development. Never mix with medicines or drive after drinking. Alcohol misuse can lead to addiction."
  },
  {
    question: "What should I do if someone gets angry when I bring up their drug use?",
    answer: "Stay calm. Anger often comes from fear or shame. Try talking at a different time using 'I care' statements. Avoid accusations. If they become aggressive, remove yourself from the situation."
  },
  {
    question: "Can addiction affect mental health?",
    answer: "Yes. Drug misuse is linked to anxiety, depression, panic attacks, and paranoia. Mental health recovery is a key part of addiction recovery."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I feel pressured by friends to use drugs?",
    answer: "Say 'No thanks, I’m good' or 'I have something important tomorrow.' Choose supportive friends who respect your boundaries. Your life is more important than peer pressure."
  },
  {
    question: "What is withdrawal?",
    answer: "Withdrawal happens when a dependent body stops receiving a drug. Symptoms include sweating, shaking, anxiety, nausea, and strong cravings. Medical supervision helps prevent complications."
  },
  {
    question: "What treatments are available for addiction?",
    answer: "Options include counseling, medically supervised detox, behavioral therapy, rehabilitation centers, and support groups. Recovery plans are personalized to the individual."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I’m scared to ask for help?",
    answer: "That’s normal. Asking for help takes courage. Start by talking to a trusted friend, teacher, doctor, or anonymous helpline. Taking the first step is the most powerful decision you can make."
